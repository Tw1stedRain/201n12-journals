# Journal Day 4 - prior life expierence

Of my priror expierence, probably what will help and tie in the easiest is the single semester long web design class i took in my freshman year of high school. It was a long time ago and I have had many different expierences between then and now, but the more I learn about HTML and CSS, the more I remember from that class. I wouldn't say I remember enought of it for it to be like review, but with every HTML concept I relearn, it sticks just that much better. On top of that there is the fact that my dad has been the Director of IT at Shoreline CC longer than I've been alive. While he never took the time to actually teach me anything specific, nor is he really all that familiar with code, it has made me much more comfortable around computers, especially the back end, than most people I know. Another important piece of expierence I gain from my dad, isn't so much my expierence as the collective expierence of everyone he works with and their willingness, and often times actual excitement, at the idea of helping me to dig my way further into the tech world.
