# journal Andragogy vs. Pedagogy

When reading that article, it made me think about all the differences in how my learning style has changed over time, and how little. I noticed that while in many aspects I can be considered an adult learner, I am motivated by the need to improve and by just the very idea of knowing more today than I did yesterday. I also noticed that there are still aspects in the way I think that can be considered pedagogy; I still strive to acheve good grades, I still fall into the habbit of letting those who are teaching me guide how, when, why I am learning. This article definitely made me think in new ways about how and why I learn.
