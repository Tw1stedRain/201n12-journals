# Internal Force

One major internal force for learning that I have is the desire to learn, improve myself, and grow. I want to be a better person professionally to give myself better prospects for the future. I want to be able to take care of myself without any help from my family, and I want to be one of the people in my family that everyone feels comfortable approaching for help if they need it.
